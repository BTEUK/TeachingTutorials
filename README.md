# TeachingTutorials

## Overview
* The BTE Teaching System or Teaching Tutorials is the next phase of tutorials on the BTE UK server and the first tutorial system to be implemented on the BTE network.
* It is the next step up in teaching players on server with an interactive system.
* It will allow tutorials to be created using a config so that tutorials can be added without code needed. No tutorials will be hard coded.
* It adds the option of multiple "Locations" being available for a single tutorial.
* It will assess a player's performance in each tutorial in a number of categories and will use this to update a player's overall rating in each of the categories.
* A player's overall rating tells the system what the player needs more work on and therefore what tutorials to make them complete next.

Overall this system would start to make use of more teaching techniques which work in the real world. It would support people independently working stuff out for themselves, a gradual buildup of difficulty as someone progresses, targeted learning in areas an applicant is not so good at and an automatic way to score people without players feeling like itâ€™s a test.
It will provide a foundation for a tutorials system which can be used throughout the Build the Earth project. It is future proofed and has much potential to be expanded upon.
