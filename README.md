# TeachingTutorials
This link gives a detailed summary of the intended plan:
**https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FBd9vSfhHPDqNUBmbLcdZRFyIyhDvNKcvEDxLDoPFLw/edit**
* The BTE Teaching System or Teaching Tutorials is the next phase of tutorials on the BTE UK server and the first tutorial system to be implemented on the BTE network.
* It is the next step up in teaching players on server with an interactive system.
* It will assess a player's performance in each tutorial in a number of categories and will use this to update a player's overall rating in each of the categories.
* A player's overall rating tells the system what the player needs more work on and therefore what tutorials to make them complete next.
* It will allow tutorials to be created using a config so that tutorials can be added without code needed.

Overall this system would start to make use of more teaching techniques which work in the real world. It would support people independently working stuff out for themselves, a gradual buildup of difficulty as someone progresses, targeted learning in areas an applicant is not so good at and an automatic way to score people without players feeling like itâ€™s a test.
